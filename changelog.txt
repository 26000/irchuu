--- VERSION 1.1.0  / LAYER 18 ---
Added an option to wait before
joining a channel. Add the following
to the end of your config file to
use this feature:
```
# how many seconds to wait before joining the channel
joindelay = 0
```

Added a `status` command. It returns
IRC status in Telegram and vice
versa. In case it says "unable to
determine" in Telegram, add this to
the end of your config file and
adjust the timeout:
```
# how many seconds to wait for server to return the list of channels we're on
# (needed for /status command in Telegram; increase if it says you're not in
# channel when you are)
statustimeout = 2
```

IRChuu~ now will not wait for IRC
to disconnect and the database to
close before exiting if you press
Ctrl+C two times.

Fixed IRChuu~ not exiting on Ctrl+C
if it failed to join the channel.

Fixed a couple other bugs.

--- VERSION 1.0.0  / LAYER 17 ---
Now IRChuu~ will show you changelogs
if updates are available.

--- VERSION 0.10.1 / LAYER 16 ---
The Telegram bot no longer leaves
the group for which it isn't
configured. New Komf versions are
now supported.

--- VERSION 0.10.0 / LAYER 15 ---
IRC ignore lists are now available.
Add the following lines to the end
of your config file to use them:
```
# list of nicknames to ignore, i. e. messages by these users won't be relayed
ignorelist = ignoredbotnickname1,ignoredbotnickname2
```

Panic on exit was fixed. Errors
sending Telegram messages are now
reported.
